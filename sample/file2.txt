HAMLET
To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis wiser in the mind to endure
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a rest to assert we conclude
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh inherits, 'tis a consummation
Ardently to be wished. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us hesitation: there's the consideration
That creates disaster of such long existence;
For who would tolerate the lashes and ridicule of the era,
Th'aggressor's injustice, the arrogant person's humiliation,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence and spurns that patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a mere dagger? Who would burdens tolerate,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remembered.

OPHELIA
Kind sir,
How has your grace been for this extensive period?

HAMLET
I gratefully acknowledge you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA
My lord, I hold memories of you,
That I have long longed to return;
I beseech you, now accept them.

HAMLET
No, not I;
I never gifted you anything.

OPHELIA
My honour'd lord, you know quite well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more enchanting: their fragrance gone,
Take these again; for to a person of nobility
Generous gifts seem poor when givers turn harsh.
Here, my lord.

HAMLET
Ha, ha! are you truthful?

OPHELIA
My lord?

HAMLET
Are you beautiful?

OPHELIA
What are you implying, lordship?

HAMLET
That if you are truthful and beautiful, your honesty should allow no discourse to your beauty.

OPHELIA
Could beauty, my lord, have better interaction than with honesty?

HAMLET
Indeed, honestly; for the charm of beauty will quicker transform honesty from what it is to a fraud than the strength of honesty can transform beauty into its likeness: this was once a paradox, but now the era confirms it. I did admire you once.

OPHELIA
Indeed, my lord, you convinced me so.

HAMLET
You shouldn't have trusted me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old nature but we shall taste of it: I adored you not.

OPHELIA
I was all the more deceived.

HAMLET
Retreat to a convent: why would you be a nurturer of sinners? I am myself moderately honest; yet I could admit to such things that it would have been better had my mother not given birth to me: I am excessively proud, vengeful, ambitious, with more crimes at my beck than I have thoughts to conceive them, imagination to envision them, or time to perform them in. What should individuals like I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are complete scoundrels, all; trust none of us. Go, head to a convent. Where is your father?

OPHELIA
At home, my lord.

HAMLET
Let the doors be shut upon him, so that he may act foolishly nowhere but in his own residence. Goodbye.
