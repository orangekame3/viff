HAMLET
To be, or not to be, that remains the question:
Whether 'tis wiser in the mind to endure
The stones and bolts of extreme misfortune,
Or to stand against a sea of dilemmas
And by confronting end them. To perish: to rest;
No more; and by a rest to assert we conclude
The heart-ache and the thousand earthly shocks
That flesh inherits, 'tis a consummation
Ardently to be wished. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perhaps to dream: oh, there's the dilemma;
For in that sleep of termination what visions might arise
When we have shuffled off this mortal realm,
Must give us hesitation: there's the consideration
That creates disaster of such long existence;
For who would tolerate the lashes and ridicule of the era,
Th'aggressor's injustice, the arrogant person's humiliation,
The agony of despised affection, the law's procrastination,
The arrogance and rejections that patient merit of th'unworthy receives,
When he himself might his quietus achieve
With a mere dagger? Who would burdens tolerate,
To groan and labor under a tiresome life,
But that the fear of something following demise,
The unknown territory from whose boundary
No explorer returns, confuses the determination
And makes us rather endure those ailments we possess
Than soar to others that we are ignorant of?
Thus awareness does produce cowards of us all;
And thus the inherent color of determination
Is tarnished with the pale shade of contemplation,
And initiatives of great scope and significance
With this consideration their paths divert incorrectly,
And forfeit the title of activity.--Quiet now!
The beautiful Ophelia! Sprite, in your prayers
May all my wrongdoings be remembered.

OPHELIA
Kind sir,
How has your grace been for this extensive period?

HAMLET
I gratefully acknowledge you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA
My lord, I hold memories of you,
That I have long longed to return;
I beseech you, now accept them.

HAMLET
No, not I;
I never gifted you anything.

OPHELIA
My honour'd lord, you know quite well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more enchanting: their fragrance gone,
Take these again; for to a person of nobility
Generous gifts seem poor when givers turn harsh.
Here, my lord.

HAMLET
Ha, ha! are you truthful?

OPHELIA
My lord?

HAMLET
Are you beautiful?

OPHELIA
What are you implying, lordship?

HAMLET
That if you are truthful and beautiful, your honesty should allow no discourse to your beauty.

OPHELIA
Could beauty, my lord, have better interaction than with honesty?

HAMLET
Indeed, honestly; for the charm of beauty will quicker transform honesty from what it is to a fraud than the strength of honesty can transform beauty into its likeness: this was once a paradox, but now the era confirms it. I did admire you once.

OPHELIA
Indeed, my lord, you convinced me so.

HAMLET
You shouldn't have trusted me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old nature but we shall taste of it: I adored you not.

OPHELIA
I was all the more deceived.

HAMLET
Retreat to a convent: why would you be a nurturer of sinners? I am myself moderately honest; yet I could admit to such things that it would have been better had my mother not given birth to me: I am excessively proud, vengeful, ambitious, with more crimes at my beck than I have thoughts to conceive them, imagination to envision them, or time to perform them in. What should individuals like I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are complete scoundrels, all; trust none of us. Go, head to a convent. Where is your father?

OPHELIA
At home, my lord.

HAMLET
Let the doors be shut upon him, so that he may act foolishly nowhere but in his own residence. Goodbye.
